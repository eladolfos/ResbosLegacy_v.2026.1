#!/bin/bash
# One-shot driver for a sharded w_asym run:
#   1. Auto-generates the shards (make_shards.py) if they don't exist yet.
#   2. Submits the shard array job (run_w_asym_array.sb).
#   3. Submits the merge job (merge_w_asym_array.sb) with
#      --dependency=afterok:<array_job_id>, so it only runs once every
#      shard has exited 0 -- if any shard fails, SLURM marks the merge
#      job's dependency as never-satisfied and cancels it automatically
#      instead of merging incomplete/missing output.
#
# Also routes SLURM's own stdout/stderr log files into
# <JOBNAME>_shards/slurm_logs/ instead of littering this directory with
# one .out/.err pair per array task. This has to happen here rather than
# inside the .sb scripts because #SBATCH --output/--error paths are opened
# by SLURM before a script's body executes, so the directory must exist at
# submission time.
#
# Usage: ./submit_w_asym_array.sh JOBNAME ARRAY_SPEC
#   ARRAY_SPEC must be of the form LOW-HIGH or LOW-HIGH%THROTTLE, with
#   LOW=0 (matches make_shards.py's shard00, shard01, ... numbering).
#   The shard count (HIGH-LOW+1) is what gets passed to make_shards.py.
#
# Example (creates 20 shards from E211_w_asym_Wm.in, runs them, merges them):
#   ./submit_w_asym_array.sh E211_w_asym_Wm 0-19
#
# If the shards already exist (from a previous make_shards.py run) and
# their count matches ARRAY_SPEC, this reuses them as-is instead of
# regenerating. To force regeneration, remove <JOBNAME>_shards/ first.
