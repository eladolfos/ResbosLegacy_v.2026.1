"""
Split a w_asym .in file into N shards along the Q grid (the outermost
loop in w_asym.f), so the shards can be run in parallel and their
outputs concatenated back into one file with no reordering.

Usage:
    python3 make_shards.py BASE_IN JOBNAME N_SHARDS

Example:
    python3 make_shards.py E211_w_asym_Wm.in E211_w_asym_Wm 20

Produces (inside ./<JOBNAME>_shards/, created if it doesn't exist):
    <JOBNAME>_shard00.in ... <JOBNAME>_shardNN.in
    <JOBNAME>_shards.manifest   (one shard name + Q range per line, in order)

w_asym is always run from this directory (so its relative ./inp/*.inp
paths keep working), so shard names in the manifest are stored as paths
relative to this directory, e.g. "<JOBNAME>_shards/<JOBNAME>_shard00".
